# Servos and Utilities
## Introduction

The scope of this project is to provide a series of open-source open-access libraries with models of simple servos.

The libraries are initially designed to be used with the aeroservoelastic code HAWC2 but can be generalized for a broader use.

The libraries so far included are:
- pitch actuator
- generator 
- mechanical brake
- flap actuator
- general filters

## Documentation

The documentation will come as soon as possible.

## Compilation

At the moment compilation is supported only with Visual Studio. Make files are on the way.

## Dependencies

The project depends on the [Basic DTU Wind Energy controller](https://github.com/DTUWindEnergy/BasicDTUController) because a file is shared between the prjects. The Visual Studio projects support the dependencies at the condition that the ServoAndUtilities and the BasicDTUController repositories are located in the same folder.
